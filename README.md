# Certificate_of_Deposit_Form

**Overview** ðŸ‘¾
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings account that requires you to lock your funds away for a specific period of time until a maturity date. In return, youâ€™ll get a higher interest rate. Typically, for tax purposes the bank provides an documentation about your CD account with details such as the amount of intrest accrued over the course of time.
