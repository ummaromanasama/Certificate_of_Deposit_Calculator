# Certificate_of_Deposit_Form

**Overview** ðŸ‘¾
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings account that requires you to lock your funds away for a specific period of time until a maturity date. In return, youâ€™ll get a higher interest rate. Typically, for tax purposes the bank provides an documentation about your CD account with details such as the amount of intrest accrued over the course of time.

The Certificate_of_Deposit_Form repository touches upon the development of a CD document through the usage of code. The CD_Calculator.py file requests data from the user such as the duration of the CD account, the deposit amount and the APY rate. As a result, it reports the total interest accrued. The CD_Header.py file displays the document's header which contains the banks and accounts holder information. Lastly, the CD_Table.py file generates a table that showcases the monthly interest accrued for the span of the agreement.

**Technologies Implemented** ðŸ’»
The program is written in Python as a choice of programming language. In order to generage the PDF's I used the python library ReportLab and its extentions for further customization such as colors, borders, and tables.

- What additonal improvments and changes could be implemented to further your project?

I was able to recreate componenets of the document that would be supplied to CD account holder while educating myself on how CD accounts function. In the future, I would like to merge all the compoentes onto on document to resemble an actual invoice. While working on this project, I was unable to bring the header component with the table component
