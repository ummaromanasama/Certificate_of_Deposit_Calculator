# Certificate_of_Deposit_Form

**Overview** ðŸ‘¾
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings account that requires you to lock your funds away for a specific period of time until a maturity date. In return, youâ€™ll get a higher interest rate. Typically, for tax purposes the bank provides an documentation about your CD account with details such as the amount of intrest accrued over the course of time.

The Certificate_of_Deposit_Form repository touches upon the development of a CD document through the usage of code. The CD_Calculator.py file request data from the user such as the duration of the CD account, the deposit amount and the APY rate. As a result it reports the total intrest accrued.

The CD_Header.py file displays the documents header which contains the banks and acounds holder information.

Lastly, the CD_Table.py file generates a table that showcases the monthly intrest accrued for the span of the argeement.
